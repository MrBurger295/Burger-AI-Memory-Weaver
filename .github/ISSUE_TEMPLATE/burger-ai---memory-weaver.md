name: Burger AI – Memory Weaver
about: An AI-powered web app built with React + Gemini API that generates an emotional
  portrait by combining a person’s childhood photo + adult photo.  This tool uses
  Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview to analyze both images and produce a single
  artistic portrait showing a child and adult together — an emotional “memory connection”
  visual.
